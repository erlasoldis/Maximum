#Design an algorithm that generates the first n numbers in the following sequence:; 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, ___, ___, ___, â€¦

# Algorithm
#1. Get input for the length of the sequence
#2. Start the sequence with 1
#3. Calculate the next number in the sequence and print it out in the sequence in the format 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, ___, ...
#4. Repeat step 3 until the input length of the sequence is reached
